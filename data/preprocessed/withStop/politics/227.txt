clarke faces id cards rebellion charles clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial id cards bill up to labour mps could oppose the scheme during a commons debate mr clarke who took on the post on thursday after david blunkett quit has rejected calls to pause on the bill tory leader michael howard also faces a possible rebellion after deciding to back identity cards the liberal democrats oppose the plans mr clarke writing in the times accused some critics of liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears by claiming id cards would erode civil liberties he writes that it is actually a profoundly civil libertarian measure because it promotes the most fundamental civil liberty in our society which is the right to live free from fear crime and fear mr clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail he is also expected to cut the cost of the card and passport for the elderly and those on lower incomes mr howard last week said his front bench team had reached a collective view to back id cards after holding a good discussion but admitted it was not an easy issue he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror crime and illegal immigration but former shadow attorney general bill cash said there was still very deep disquiet about the plan among senior tories he told bbc radio s today the government was intensely authoritarian and was creating increasingly a big brother society critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim ministers say it would help the fight against terrorism illegal immigration and organised crime but opponents say that similar schemes in other countries have not prevented attacks like the madrid rail bombing on sunday lib dem leader charles kennedy repeated his call for a pause in considering the legislation he told bbc s breakfast with frost programme that mr clarke had a real opportunity on monday following the departure of mr blunkett if you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the identity cards bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the new year that is the sensible way to go about it but i think this government has got itself so much into tram lines now that it is not behaving sensibly at all the first cards would be issued in and when he was introducing the bill mr blunkett suggested parliament could decide in or whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards although not to carry them the new bill would also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents
