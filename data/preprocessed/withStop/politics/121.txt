nhs waiting time target is cut hospital waiting times for patients in wales are to be cut but not to the same extent as those in england welsh health minister jane hutt said no patient would wait more than months for an outpatient appointment by march against a current target of months but she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at months for march the announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop this current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside wales details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the new year in england the current target for inpatients seeing a consultant to having an operation is six months dr richard lewis welsh secretary of the british medical association bma welcomed the new targets to make further and faster progress on waiting lists however much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because wales still lags a long way behind england he said capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that welsh patients don t receive a worse service than patients over the border health analyst tony beddow from the welsh institute for health and social care called the new targets reasonably impressive on wednesday ms hutt also announced m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in wales ms hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year we are turning the corner on long waits in wales now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again she said she added the targets intended to ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant but let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months and these targets affect the small minority of patients in wales that are waiting far too long rhodri glyn thomas plaid cymru health spokesman said it s exactly the same target she set in with the qualification that it s dependent on a second offer it s a failed target from a failed minister with a failed policy for the welsh liberal democrats kirsty williams called the new target hugely unambitious it leaves patients in wales still waiting two years before they re treated conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said we re spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof the audit commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively and that s quite a criticism meanwhile the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than months as an inpatient in wales has fallen by statistics to the end of november showed a decline since october from to the number waiting over months also fell from to or ms hutt said they were excellent figures there are people on a waiting list of some kind down from last month
