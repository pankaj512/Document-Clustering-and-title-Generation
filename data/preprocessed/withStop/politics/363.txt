kennedy criticises unfair taxes gordon brown has failed to tackle the fundamental unfairness in the tax system in his ninth budget charles kennedy has said how was it right that the poorest of society were still paying more as a proportion of their income than the richest the lib dem leader asked the new council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the unfair tax he added the government could not go on patching up the system he added speaking in the commons after mr brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last budget before the general election mr kennedy acknowledged that the uk was one of the most successful economies in the world but he criticised both the chancellor and the tories for failing to address the ticking bomb of council tax revaluation he said the recent experience of wales indicated seven million households in england would pay significantly more after revaluation the chancellor s announcement that he was to offer a council tax rebate paid by pensioner households was merely a sticking plaster to a much bigger problem the lib dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than a year with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off on pensions mr kennedy said it was a scandal that the system discriminated against women who had missed making national insurance payments when they were having children he said a residency criteria would end at a stroke this fundamental iniquity mr kennedy added his party s priorities of free long term care for the elderly abolishing top up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging income tax to those earning more than per annum he contrasted his approach with mr brown s pledge in not to increase income tax the chancellor went on to put up national insurance contributions after the election for most individuals most families most households it adds up to exactly the same thing said mr kennedy and they wonder why people get cynical about their politicians when they give one impression before an election and do exactly the opposite after that election
