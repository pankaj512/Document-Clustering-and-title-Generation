howard attacks pay later budget tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown s budget as vote now pay later spending plans the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole mr howard said everyone could see the chancellor s sweeteners but these hid tax rises for hard working families he said labour s faltering election campaign would not be helped by the package of measures mr howard added mr brown s budget was not about what was good for the country but all about the interests of the labour party the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging millions of people in to the net to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax we can all see the sweeteners but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard working families that are inevitable if labour wins he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced their only answer is to tax to spend and to waste to get people to vote now and pay later mr brown liked to rattle off magical balances conjured out of thin air in a bid to convince people there was no black hole in the nation s finances the tory leader said this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers he said you now propose to borrow over the next six years no less than billion so much for prudence the chancellor s forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister s forecasts of weapons of mass destruction mr brown s council tax rebate for pensioners was less than what the tories were offering mr howard said there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools people would face a clear choice at the election either more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives he said that s the battleground of this election that s what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on he concluded to loud tory cheering
