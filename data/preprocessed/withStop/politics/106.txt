howard attacks cost of asylum michael howard has launched an attack on the cost of britain s chaotic asylum system under tony blair the tory leader said english local authorities have spent more than bn or per household on asylum since labour won power in mr howard is expected to tell activists in kent that voters tolerance and desire to help others are being abused other parties and refugee agencies have already attacked tory plans for annual limits on numbers mr howard said britain should take its fair share of the world s genuine refugees the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz where my grandmother was murdered along with over a million others has reminded all of us that we have a moral responsibility to those fleeing persecution he was due to say but if we are to fulfil responsibility we have to get a grip of the system fair play matters people want a government that upholds the rules not one that turns a blind eye when they are bent and abused he said and let s be clear our asylum system is being abused and with it britain s generosity earlier this week mr howard said his party s plans to cut immigration were not racist arguing they would make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees if elected his party would institute an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas that prompted some charities to say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled if we have a moral responsibility towards people fleeing persecution then these policies will not provide a safe haven said hannah ward of the refugee council if people turn up in the uk asking for help they will be turned away michael howard s policy effectively means there is no safe haven in the uk when it comes to costs then perhaps we should start with how decisions are made on asylum seekers so many of them are shown to be wrong one in five decisions that are appealed are successfully overturned rising to half for some nationalities we need good quality decision making on asylum applications because it is delays in the system which cost so much tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans by cutting the number of front line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set on monday mr howard said it s not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it
