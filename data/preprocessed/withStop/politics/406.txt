profile gordon brown the ultimate prize of downing street may continue to elude him but as he prepares to deliver a record breaking ninth budget gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times he reached that milestone last june when he overtook david lloyd george who served for seven years and days between and how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear he once said there are two types of chancellor those who fail and those who get out in time there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election but for now mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors or politicians before him gordon brown was born in glasgow on february the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy at he was canvassing for labour and by his s he was a leading political activist in scotland he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university where he went on to complete a phd his early career was spent lecturing working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party his first attempt to enter westminster for edinburgh south in was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs michael ancram but in he took dunfermline east a new constituency including rosyth naval base pit villages and coastal towns entering westminster he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield tony blair within four years mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury he became shadow chancellor under john smith s leadership in after the death of leader john smith in he stood aside agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington the other part of the deal that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor is the stuff of westminster legend mr blair s supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns and even a television film have been devoted to the alleged deal but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in mr brown continued his devotion to politics during the election campaign he is said to have worked an average of hours a day six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown s former girlfriend of five years princess marguerite of romania the eldest daughter of ex king michael of romania who said a relationship with him was politics politics politics if that was true then mr brown who married pr executive sarah macaulay in changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary days after being born seven weeks prematurely a year later in october the couple had a son john an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side a trip to africa earlier this year to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more old labour than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession mr blair for his part is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute after a recent run of negative headlines labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering for the good of the party events like this and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues make it impossible to dismiss the brown blair feud as just journalistic hearsay cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown using the budget as a springboard is to revitalise labour s campaign amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown including mr milburn but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can and mr blair s decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for even if the prime minister s intention to serve a full third term if elected took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters
