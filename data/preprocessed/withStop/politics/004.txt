labour chooses manchester the labour party will hold its autumn conference in manchester and not blackpool it has been confirmed the much trailed decision was ratified by labour s ruling national executive committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue it will be the first time since that the party has chosen manchester to host the annual event blackpool will get the much smaller february spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move for years the main political parties have rotated between blackpool bournemouth and brighton and the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort in the party said it would not return to blackpool but did so in the following year bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for brighton to host the autumn conference colin asplin blackpool hotel association said we have tried very hard to make sure they come back to blackpool obviously we have failed in that i just hope manchester can handle the crowds it amazes me that the labour party which is a working class party doesn t want to come to the main working class resort in the country the exact cost to blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major manchester hotels after the official announcement
