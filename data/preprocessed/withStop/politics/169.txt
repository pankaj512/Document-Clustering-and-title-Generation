no one can define new hunt ban the new law banning hunting with dogs is so poorly drafted no one can define the offence pro hunt mps say the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to chase away unwanted animals from his farm because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting chasing away and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group of which mr opik is a co chairman after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry defra he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence prompting him to complain the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra s lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act therefore you would not be committing an offence mr opik said hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting chasing away which isn t even covered by the act however all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting exempt hunting drag hunting unintentional hunting a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away tory mp peter luff another co chairman of middle way said that the legislation was so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law however i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating mike hobday of the league against cruel sports said there is no confusion it is a matter of simple common sense if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence if all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer then nobody can define that as hunting
