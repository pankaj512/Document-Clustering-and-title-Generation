blunkett row should end blair prime minister tony blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding david blunkett the tories and the lib dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast tracking of a visa application for mr blunkett s ex lover s nanny sir alan budd found a chain of events linked mr blunkett to leoncia casalme s indefinite leave to remain application at the end of his middle east trip mr blair said he still admired mr blunkett and thought his integrity was intact on tuesday sir alan said the application for leave to remain in the uk made by kimberly quinn s nanny was processed in days days faster than the average but he could not find evidence to show whether mr blunkett s intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover s nanny or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance in his first comments since sir alan s announcement mr blair told bbc news he had not yet read the report in detail but told bbc news as far as i m concerned we have drawn a line under that asked if mr blunkett could return to frontline politics at some point he replied i have made my admiration for david very clear and it remains he s been a tremendous colleague he s done a great job for us first as home secretary then as education secretary the future is something we will have to approach in the future the prime minister shrugged off claims from conservative leader michael howard that he led a grubby government he said mr blunkett s integrity remained intact he was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up he accepted that what he originally thought had happened had not happened he said but i think sir alan budd also accepted there wasn t some conspiracy or cover up and i just think a line should be drawn under now and we should move on earlier mr howard said there does need to be another inquiry a judge led inquiry there were so many questions that weren t answered there was deceit at the heart of government which was not limited to the visa affair he argued lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten also said there was a strong case for a judge led judicial review he said next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa it may be about something even more important than that mr blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of sir alan s findings in a statement the ex home secretary said he accepted the inquiry s findings he said he had told the truth throughout and had raised the nanny case as an example of unacceptable backlogs in the system
