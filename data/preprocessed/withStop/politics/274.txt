the memory driving brown s mission the memory gordon brown says keeps returning to him the one that he says is burnt into him is that of a year old girl whose parents died of aids and who is hiv positive herself mr brown seems haunted by her eyes desolate of all hope and then he talks of those eyes that do inspire optimism an extraordinary performance by schoolgirls of kenya s largest slum advancing with crowded menace flicking their hips in a manner almost as disturbing before the finale of a clenched fist salute and shout of free education free education for all mr brown s message generally that compassion must become action before that hope is squandered but he is such a pivotal figure in british politics it is almost impossible not to ask him why he is doing this his answer in part is because of the missionaries that used to come to his father s church ever since he says africa has been important to him i ve absolutely no doubt whatsoever this is heartfelt but he also believes it is time for the world to see a new gordon brown not the dull reassuring bank manager but a man driven by a moral passion and it just so happens the labour party feels an awful lot happier ridding the world of debt than ridding the world of dictators there s also a sense of liberation if mr blair won t allow him to run the election campaign then he can at least pretend it was all getting tedious and he d much rather be out examining social problems in the raw it also goes some way to solving one of the overarching problems for all politicians of all parties scepticism sliding into cynicism about politics itself if he can help the world s poor just a little then it shows politics isn t worthless but is his vision for africa too grand can poverty in the continent really be halved brown replies that no one thought the berlin wall would ever come down either he s still got to overcome not only the reluctance of other finance ministers in the world but also the cynicism of experts who wonder whether debt relief will just be squandered by governments that just won t in the end spend wisely
