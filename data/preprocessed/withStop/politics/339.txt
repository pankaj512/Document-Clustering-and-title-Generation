lib dems target first time buyers the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build new affordable homes on publicly owned land the party s scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust as a way of getting onto the housing ladder the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites labour has already announced plans to help first time buyers and the tories would extend right to buy schemes all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run up to the election after a survey suggested first time buyers could not afford a home in of uk towns the lib dems say their mutual homes would let people buy a share of a property usually worth about of the building costs party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land donated by central or local government people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land he added they would spend about of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property when they moved house they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account mr kennedy said mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually investing only as much as they can afford there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities the kind of golden share used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely under the plan councils secure deals with developers where they keep a share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market instead they are sold at build cost to people who the local council decides have local needs the party says its help for first time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer but the plans involve changing the vat system which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to on every new house this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes labour has said it will allow council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the government s strategy however as usual the lib dems proposals are completely uncosted he said mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour s promise to spend bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by
