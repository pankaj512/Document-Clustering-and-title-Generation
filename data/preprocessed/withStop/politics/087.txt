howard unveils tory asylum plans tory plans to cut immigration to the uk are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees michael howard has said as his party set out detailed asylum reform plans mr howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs there would be an annual limit on asylum and all claims would be processed overseas some charities say the plans would put refugees lives at risk if they were turned away once quotas were filled tony blair said labour would set out workable plans for tackling immigration abuse in the next few weeks and attacked the tory plans by cutting the number of front line immigration staff at our borders they will actually make the problem worse said mr blair liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said there needed to be a quick fair and firm asylum system but he said it was absolutely disgusting to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees the conservatives say there is little risk of this happening as demand for asylum will be considered when quotas are set in a speech in london on monday mr howard said it s not racist as some people to claim to talk about controlling immigration far from it he said that coming from an immigrant family himself he recognised that firm but fair immigration controls were essential for good community relations withdrawing from the united nations convention on refugees which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need not numbers introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the uk a worry for national security stop considering asylum applications inside the uk and instead take people from united nations refugee agency camps anyone applying for asylum would be taken to new centres close to their countries of origin the tories also want quotas for those seeking work permits through an australian style points system and those wanting to join families in the uk mr howard said nearly people were settling in the uk every year the size of a city like peterborough the plans would help achieve a substantial reduction in immigration he said although he could not predict a figure he said that only two out of asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current unfair and inhumane system we need to break the link between arriving in britain and claiming asylum mr howard said by breaking that link we can smash the criminal gangs at the heart of the trade in people smuggling but the un refugees agency is worried the policy sends the wrong message to poorer countries which receive the bulk of refugees and a spokesman for european justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini said the plans would contravene eu asylum policy which meant the uk could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case refugee council chief executive maeve sherlock called the plans dangerous ill thought out and hugely irresponsible lives could be put at risk if refugees were turned away once the quotas were filled she warned commission for racial equality chairman trevor phillips said asylum applications were down and economic migration down about he did not think mr howard intended to centre the debate about race but he warned that some campaigners could use his words to hint the policy was about keeping out people of a different colour or culture mr howard called that suggestion disgraceful
