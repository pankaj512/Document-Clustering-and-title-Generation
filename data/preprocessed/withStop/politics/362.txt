brown comes out shooting labour may have abolished hunting but that didn t stop chancellor gordon brown using his budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties core election foxes specifically it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families in a relatively short speech he kept the best for last and was clearly out to give exactly that pre election boost everyone had been predicting so if you are a couple with children a pensioner a patient or a youngster there was something pulled from mr brown s red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a new labour government like a surgeon he attempted to target his handouts with absolute precision onto exactly the groups the government needs to appeal to in the election campaign the announcements brought great cheers from his own mps who are now in full on election mode and had been looking to their man to give them ammunition for the doorsteps they obviously believed he had done that for them and coincidentally given his own image as a prime minister in waiting another little boost labour mps for example will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive a lovely old labour word this chancellor really is but gordon brown is never going to put on a show and even as he was out to cast himself as the man who will win labour an historic third term his demeanour remained quiet confident and reassuring prudence made an appearance albeit towards the end of his address as he assured voters he would do nothing to mess up the economic stability he had brought to britain and which he claimed would be thrown away by anyone else according to the opposition parties however it is all one big con trick as always they accused him of glossing over the facts of the black hole at the centre of his finances which they claim would ensure tax increases after the election he did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax as liberal democrat leader charles kennedy claimed for most families the distinction between income tax and a tax on income is meaningless tory leader michael howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use he branded it a dodgy vote now pay later budget based on dodgy figures from a dodgy government that gave britain the dodgy dossier where the chancellor mostly avoided direct electioneering mr howard felt no such constraint with attacks like comparing mr brown s forecasts to the prime minister s forecasts on iraq s weapons of mass destruction as ever there will now be a period of frantic activity by the opposition parties treasury specialists as they pore over the chancellor s red book which sets out the fine detail of his budget in an attempt to spot the flaws in particular there will be an argument over precisely whose policies on the council tax will offer people the best deal and in labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister gordon brown will make at some point after the next election
