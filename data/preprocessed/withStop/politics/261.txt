labour s election love in peace and love have been in short supply in the labour party in recent days if press reports are to be believed alan milburn and gordon brown have been at each other s throats over the contents of labour s next election manifesto but the pair were all smiles on tuesday morning as they joined john prescott to unveil labour s latest poster campaign the event at old billingsgate fish market on the banks of the thames was a carefully choreographed show of unity and the surest sign yet that we are heading for a general election in the next few months it was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years the first inkling something slightly odd was afoot was when in place of the soft rock music normally chosen for such occasions labour s speakers crackled to life with the sound of booker t and the mgs then a vw camper van trundled into view decked out in that most mind bending of psychedelic messages lowest mortgage rate for years as the side door slid open it looked for one glorious moment as if the cabinet had decided to bury their differences and go on the road together scooby doo style but sadly it wasn t the cabinet who had raided the dressing up box just six rather ill at ease looking labour students two were dressed as regency dandies to unveil a poster trumpeting the longest period of economic growth for years another pair of students were in a beatle wig and sgt pepper jacket to highlight the lowest interest rates since the s the remaining two were dressed in a vague approximation of disco chic to demonstrate the lowest unemployment since the seventies the politicians led out by john prescott were soberly suited as always the event may have been designed to highlight labour s economic success under mr brown but there was little doubt who was in charge the chancellor walked side by side with mr milburn pointedly exchanging chit chat as they approached the microphone but it was mr milburn who took centre stage speaking of the positive campaign the party hoped to stage in the coming weeks and months the mobile poster vans would let people know britain is working again mr brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of labour s shared purpose and united dedication it was left to mr prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor s record and in a final flourish to produce his famous pledge card from claiming labour has met all of its promises the event was carefully stage managed to underline cabinet unity and more specifically to demonstrate the central role mr brown will play in the election campaign despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of mr milburn but keen students of body language will have had a field day there was much forced smiling for the cameras but only mr prescott who revels in such occasions seemed to be truly enjoying himself mr milburn made a point of turning to face the chancellor as he spoke nodding thoughtfully but it was the former health secretary s final gesture placing an arm on mr brown s back as they walked away from the microphones which was perhaps the most telling thanks for dropping by gordon he might have been saying
