feta cheese battle reaches court a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name the commission s decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term with the cheese produced widely outside greece the commission s controversial ruling gave protected designation of origin status to feta cheese made in greece effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there from onwards greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese hans arne kristiansen a spokesman for the danish dairy board told the bbc denmark is europe s second largest producer of feta after greece producing about tonnes a year and exports its products to greece it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation mr kristiansen said that is just one of the costs the case will also have a major impact on britain s sole feta producer yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses judy bell the company s founder said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product if we lose we will have to go through a massive re merchandising process and reorganisation she said we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone s eyes it s very clear from the label that it s yorkshire feta the original decision was a victory for greece where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about years feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat s milk and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine greece makes tonnes mainly for domestic consumption the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn
