fresh hope after argentine crisis three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis there is fresh hope the country s economy is set to grow about this year after seeing growth last year a sharp turnaround from when output fell the unemployment rate is improving too it is set to slip below by the end of the year down from in may true problems remain but the overall picture is one of vast improvement even the international monetary fund imf admits this the argentine authorities are proud should be proud of the strong performance of the economy thomas dawson an imf director said earlier this month argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which at least initially was made worse by the government s decisions pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country s massive debts in response angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month argentina was on the brink of collapse the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso s decade long peg to the us dollar in february the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people s life savings disappear scathes of companies went bust three years ago every sector of the economy was hit by the crisis said entrepreneur drayton valentine it really was dire but since then the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil agriculture and tourism are helping said entrepreneur drayton valentine mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina was fortunate at the time of the crisis his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad but now he is using his money to help with the start up a trading company he explained that initially his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states then he would like to diversify to other areas depending on the market locally there is a sense of recovery many companies are exporting now he said noting that a lot of firms which were closed during the crisis are re opening but not all that shines is gold argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of president nestor kirchner s administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors but with the debts nominal value standing at around bn it is not proving easy debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate argentina s current offer implies that the creditors would get just cents for each dollar they are owed according to the creditors understandably they want more and until they do both they and others are loath to continue lending for president kirchner this proves a hopeless challenge real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay observed jack boorman adviser to imf s managing director rodrigo rato everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached he said the cost is enormous and continues to be paid and will not be reversed by any restructuring with the international negotiations being troubled it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina said carlos baez silva president of aara an association that represents bank account and bond holders few people have recovered more than about half their savings mr baez silva estimated pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe a lot of them invested in good faith he said the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country s legal system on occasion the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents he says insisting that the system cannot be trusted people have to deposit their money in the banks not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses mr valentine who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina agreed if i have to save pesos the local currency there is not much problem but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank
