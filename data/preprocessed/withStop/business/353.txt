debt relief tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries providing jobs for million people in the south east asian region according to the world travel and tourism council wttc in the maldives islands in the indian ocean two thirds of all jobs depend on tourism but the damage covers fishing farming and businesses too with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves international agencies have pledged their support most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet the international monetary fund imf has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need said managing director rodrigo rato only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support while indonesia the quake s epicentre has recently graduated from imf assistance it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help other agencies such as the asian development bank have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed there is no underestimating the size of the problem however the united nations emergency relief coordinator jan egeland said that this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas so many vulnerable communities many people will have had their livelihoods their whole future destroyed in a few seconds he warned that the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year the region that s affected is very big so we have to check country by country what the situation is said serge troeber deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re the world s second biggest reinsurance firm i should assume however that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us he said munich re the world s biggest reinsurer said this is primarily a human tragedy it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability however a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there the

humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster other countries also are reported to have pledged cash while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend s events many of the worst hit areas such as sri lanka thailand s phuket island and the maldives are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post slump growth has been
