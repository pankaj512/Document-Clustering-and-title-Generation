williams battles to aussie title serena williams staged a remarkable recovery to beat lindsay davenport and win her second australian open title the champion claimed her seventh grand slam title and her first since wimbledon in williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games she quickly dropped the first set but from in the second found another gear as davenport s game collapsed allowing williams to take the title williams later explained her injury problem saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set lindsay had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually i was able to come back thank goodness she said davenport paid tribute to williams saying she s had a tough couple of years and she s come back like a champion the year old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action davenport took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second i kept thinking to myself i m not losing this game said williams afterwards i don t care if my arm falls off i m not losing this game and i guess that s what happened i didn t want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence despite letting the break points slip away davenport looked comfortable enough at but from up she just folded williams won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre davenport looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks i felt like i was playing well and in control pretty much of the match said davenport then i just had that horrible lapse i think serving up and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it at the end i think i was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going she s a great frontrunner when she gets going
