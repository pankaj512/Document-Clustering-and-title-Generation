sella wants michalak recall former france centre philippe sella believes coach bernard laporte must recall frederic michalak to give his side any chance of beating ireland sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly half yann delaigue in the rbs six nations to date but he told bbc sport michalak is the answer both now and for the future delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back michalak he does have weaknesses but has the all round game to upset ireland the year old michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after delaigue impressed for castres early in the season with michalak overlooked the french stuttered to narrow wins over scotland and then england before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to wales the wales game was amazing to watch but never did i think the french could lose that game at half time said sella their only mistakes were that they didn t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second but only a little bit sella however insisted the pressure had eased on the under fire laporte despite the defeat at the stade de france this season is very important for shaping a team for the world cup said sella which laporte is doing very well the french get better every game it s difficult though when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel but he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to world cup victory as a result it is important that people give him time it may not seem good now that we re not winning the grand slam but no one will care in two years time if we re world champions the majority of media criticism centred on the way in which france produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games but while sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against wales he said the win was most important winning is all that matters he added ok the flair may not have been so good but the discipline organisation and defence was there which are all important ahead of france play what sella believes is their hardest game of the six nations against ireland in dublin on saturday march the french go into the game as clear underdogs but sella added people forget that france can still win the six nations and they ll be focused on that but ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd it s going to be tough
