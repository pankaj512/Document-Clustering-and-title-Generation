bees handed potential man utd tie brentford face a home tie against holders manchester united in the fa cup sixth round if they can come through their replay against southampton the league one side held the saints at st mary s in their fifth round tie and were rewarded with a potential draw against sir alex ferguson s side newcastle will be at home to either tottenham or nottingham forest bolton host arsenal or sheffield united and leicester will visit the winners of the burnley and blackburn replay the ties will be played on the weekend of march was delighted to be paired with united although he admitted they still have plenty of work to do to set up a dream tie we ve got our work cut out next tuesday but you can t deny it s exciting he said it would be a sell out it will probably be on television we have financial problems and the revenue it could bring in would certainly help our situation we re happy to be in the draw but we ve still got to beat a premiership team we ve got to beat southampton first and that s going to be a hard game but if we do there will be some celebration welcomed the opportunity to face united we re not counting on anything yet he said it is obviously going to be a difficult replay judging by the way brentford came back at us on saturday and the fact that united have come out of the hat will give them even more incentive but i ve been drawn against united so many times in cups and beaten them at both bournemouth and west ham there are no easy ties in the fa cup and i m sure nobody is counting on one newcastle v tottenham or nottingham forest southampton or brentford v manchester united bolton v arsenal or sheffield united burnley or blackburn v leicester
