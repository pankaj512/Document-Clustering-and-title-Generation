moyes u turn on beattie dismissal everton manager david moyes will discipline striker james beattie after all for his headbutt on chelsea defender william gallas the scot initially defended beattie whose dismissal put everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost saying gallas overreacted but he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again he said i believe that i should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct moyes added my comments on saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when i had only had the opportunity to see one very quick re run of the incident the club website also reported that beattie who seemed unrepentant after saturday s match insisting gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if he had headbutted him has now apologised moyes continued although the incident was totally out of character james has never even been suspended before in his career his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team mates james did issue a formal apology to myself his team mates and to the everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done he will now be subjected to the normal club discipline he is a competitive player but a fair player and i know how upset he is by what has happened however i must say that i do still believe the chelsea player in question did go down too easily speaking immediately after the game moyes said i don t think it was a sending off i have been a centre half in my time and i would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that not in a million years would john terry have gone down in the same way i have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them what has happened to big strong centre halves i thought it was a push initially and i still don t think it was a sending off an angry beattie initially said he gallas would have stayed down a lot longer if i had headbutted him i can tell you it wasn t an intentional headbutt we were chasing a ball into the corner and william gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off he was stopping as we were running and i said to myself if you re going to stay in my way i ll go straight over you our heads barely touched and it wasn t an intentional headbutt
