hodgson shoulders england blame fly half charlie hodgson admitted his wayward kicking played a big part in england s defeat to france hodgson failed to convert three penalties and also missed a relatively easy drop goal attempt which would have given england a late win i m very disappointed with the result and with my myself hodgson said it is very hard to take but it s something i will have to get through and come back stronger my training s been good but it just didn t happen hodgson revealed that olly barkley had taken three penalties because they were out of my range but the centre could not convert his opportunities either particularly the drop goal late on it wasn t a good strike he added i felt as soon as it hit my boot it had missed it s very disappointing but i must recover andy robinson said he would keep working on the kicking with his squad however the england coach added that he would take some positives from the defeat we went out to play and played some very good rugby and what have france done he said they won the game from kicking penalties from our m line it s very frustrating the lads showed a lot of ambition in the first half they went out to sustain it in the second but couldn t build on it we took the ball into contact and you know when you do that it is a lottery whether the referee is going to give the penalty to your side or the other side we have lost a game we should have won there is a fine line between winning and losing and for the second week we ve been on the wrong side of that line and it hurts england went in at half time with a lead but they failed to score in the second half and dimitri yachvili slotted over four penalties as france overhauled the deficit england skipper jason robinson admitted his side failed to cope with france s improved second half display we controlled the game in the first half but we knew that they would come out and try everything after half time he said we made a lot of mistakes in the second half and they punished us they took their chances when they came it s very disappointing last week we lost by two points now one point
