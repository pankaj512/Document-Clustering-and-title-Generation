record fails to lift lacklustre meet yelena isinbayeva may have produced another world pole vault record but her achievement could not hide the fact it was not the best meet we have ever seen in birmingham and hey there are not many meets that go by without the russian breaking a world record apparently isinbayeva has cleared five metres in training and i would just love her to put us out of our misery and have a go at it rather than extending the indoor record by one centimetre at a time athletics to me is all about pushing the barriers and being the best you can and i would like to see her have a go at m in competition mind you every time she breaks the record she gets so she can afford to be deliberate about it world records aside i thought it was a very encouraging evening s work for kelly holmes she looked good and was very positive agnes samaria who came second is in very good shape and is in the world s top three m runners this season yes samaria let kelly get away but there was no coming back over the last m as kelly dominated the race so beating samaria is a bit of a benchmark for kelly my gut feeling is that kelly would like to run in the european indoor championships but she just hasn t convinced herself she is fit enough to do so on the other hand i think jason gardener is struggling to come near what is going to be required to win the men s m in madrid he started well in the final but still could not stay with the front runners jason has a lot of experience indoors but for some reason he is struggling to maintain his pace through to the finish it would have been nice to see what mark lewis francis could have done in the final if only he hadn t got himself disqualified he was blatantly playing the false start game to his advantage but it tripped him up and made him look a bit silly my view is you re meant to go when the gun goes and not before and if you try to unsettle your rivals by employing the false start tactic you have to remember not to false start yourself again having said that mark is looking in much better shape but i haven t seen anything from mark or jason yet which suggests france s ronald pognon who has run seconds will be under threat at the europeans from a british point of view sarah claxton s victory in the m hurdles was the best thing to come out of the meet something else that probably went unnoticed was melanie purkiss winning the women s national m race in a new personal best of seconds aaas champion kim wall came second in another lifetime best so we have a very strong x m squad going to the european championships scotland s lee mcconnell is probably going to run too so we have a real prospect of a medal from an international perspective i thought meseret defar was disappointing in the m but i don t think the pace making was great canadian heather hennigar set a fast early pace but could not maintain it and if jo pavey had been in last year s shape she would have given defar a real run for her money she had a go but just could not hang in there we were also expecting a bit more from bernard lagat in the men s m but he has only just come over from the usa so he may not be that sharp and i still think he is in great shape as for kenenisa bekele he was well beaten by markos geneti but we only had half expectations for bekele as he has been struggling this season it was very hot in the national indoor arena and i felt uncomfortable in the commentary box i think those conditions affected the distance runners and in fact defar complained to her coach after the race that she could not get her breath properly
