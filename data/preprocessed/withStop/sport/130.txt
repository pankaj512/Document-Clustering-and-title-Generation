weir poised for sunderland move larne s teenage star robbie weir is poised to join sunderland after turning down a move to stoke city the year old irish league midfielder was also being chased by rangers and fulham but mick mccarthy s side appear to have won the race but larne boss jimmy mcgeough has yet to confirm that weir is on his way from inver park i heard on sunday that he has joined sunderland but not from the lad himself he said robbie has an agreement with larne that he can negotiate with interested clubs personally i would rather see him making an impact at local level to build up his physique before moving into the full time game he has been on trial with a number of clubs but it would be great to see him making it at sunderland
