wenger steps up row arsene wenger has stepped up his feud with sir alex ferguson by claiming the manchester united manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute the pair s long running row was put back in the headlines on saturday when ferguson said his arsenal counterpart was a disgrace wenger initially refused to bite back saying only i will never answer any questions any more about this man but now he claims ferguson should be punished by the football association the latest twist in the ferguson wenger saga came on saturday when the united boss in an interview with the independent newspaper discussed the events after the game between the two sides in october united won that day at old trafford but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw ferguson s clothes covered in soup and pizza the sides meet again at highbury on february in the tunnel wenger was criticising my players calling them cheats so i told him to leave them alone and behave himself ferguson said on saturday he ran at me with hands raised saying what do you want to do about it to not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable it s a disgrace but i don t expect wenger to ever apologise he s that type of person those allegations were put to wenger after saturday s game at bolton which arsenal lost to slip points behind chelsea in the title race at first he said only i ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened if he has to talk he talks if he wants to make a newspaper article he makes a newspaper article he doesn t interest me and doesn t matter to me at all i will never answer to any provocation from him any more he does what he likes in england anyway he can go abroad one day and see how it is but later on saturday according to the independent wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction i have no diplomatic relations with him the arsenal boss is quoted as saying what i don t understand is that he does what he wants and you the press are all at his feet the situation concerning the food fight has been judged and there is a game going on in a month the managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game but in england you are only punished for what you say after the game now the whole story starts again i don t go into that game we play football i am a football manager and i love football above all no matter what people say reminded that ferguson called him a disgrace wenger added i don t respond to anything in england you have a good phrase it is bringing the game into disrepute but that is not only after a game it is as well before a game ferguson had also claimed that united chief executive david gill and arsenal vice chairman david dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public but ferguson added in the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense gill phoned dein three times to complain but nothing was done the return is on february and they will come out with another diatribe david gill and i feel we should set the record straight because arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here meanwhile the league managers association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on going row during that stormy game in october united striker ruud van nistelrooy caught arsenal s ashley cole with one particularly strong tackle wenger later accused van nistelrooy of cheating and was fined and severely reprimanded by the football association ferguson admitted on saturday that van nistelrooy s tackle which earned the dutchman a ban could have given cole a serious injury but he believes arsenal were the main aggressors wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit he added they are the worst losers of all time they don t know how to lose maybe it is just manchester united they don t lose many games to other teams we tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was arsenal s up until last season in fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue but to wenger it never happens it is all some dream or nightmare
