wales hails new superstar one game into his six nations career and gavin henson is already a welsh legend a mesmeric display against england topped off by his howitzer of a match winning penalty has secured life membership of that particular club at henson has the rugby world at his silver booted feet and if his natural self assurance and swagger is shared by his wales team mates then a full blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the valleys the red dragonhood subdued the red rose army in most areas of the field but henson s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others he announced himself in the game s opening salvo with a welcome to cardiff greeting for mark cueto on the gain line and his defence was a major feature of the match his principal victim poor old or rather young mathew tait the england centre will have spent his th birthday on sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up ended not just once but twice by henson s all enveloping tackles the second time after the interval single handedly lifted the record millennium stadium crowd at a time when england were starting to show menace showing awesome strength henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid air a master predator toying with his helpless prey savouring the kill his kicking game also prospered particularly when he moved to full back for minutes either side of half time when his captain gareth thomas was in the sin bin one huge clearance from tait s kick sent england retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half henson was also creativity personified one little chip ahead for shane williams narrowly missed its target a precise cross kick forcing jamie noon to fumble the ball into touch he also had a hand in the game s only try finished superbly by williams and might have scored himself on the half hour as he glided into space only to be scragged by tait henson was twice repelled as wales laid siege to the english line after charlie hodgson s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time but he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din and the outcome of the match fell to him replacement gareth cooper made the most of a poor welsh scrum by chipping into space where jason robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle five metres in from the right touchline metres out it was not a kick stephen jones who had seen a long range effort fall agonisingly under the bar would have approached with confidence it was out of steve s range but i looked at gavin and he gave me a reassuring nod said thomas henson surveying his date with destiny positively relished the responsibility and the chance to make himself a hero without further ado he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of english dominance and years of waiting in cardiff i knew i was going to get it before i even took the kick he said later his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape i have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn t a problem there were still four minutes for wales to hold out and the frenzy was such that henson could not even hear jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away but it was wales who finished the game on the attack almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax just do it implored the front page headline on saturday s western mail newspaper and thanks to henson wales did
