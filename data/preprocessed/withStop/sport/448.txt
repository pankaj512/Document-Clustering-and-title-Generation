kuznetsova failed a drugs test us open champion svetlana kuznetsova has tested positive for a banned drug according to belgian authorities belgian sports minister claude eerdekens said that the russian world number five tested positive for the stimulant ephedrine on december kuznetsova was playing in an exhibition event in charleroi at the time eerdekens said there is a problem ephedrine was discovered she remains innocent until proved guilty she can ask for it to be tested again the situation remains unclear as the tournament was not commissioned by the world anti doping agency wada the international tennis federation itf or the women s tennis accosiation wta the test was carried out by regional belgian authorities and kuznetsova has not yet been able to have a b sample tested speaking at the australian open on monday before eerdekens identified her kuznetsova said i m not worried i m not using anything to push myself i have not been notified of any positive test and i think it is unfair that it s come out the way it did eerdekens said that confirmation of the findings was sent last friday to the player s address in spain as well as to the belgian prosecutors office and the belgian and russian tennis federations he conceded kuznetsova might have taken a medicine which contained the banned substance we have simply stated a fact he said it is for the federation concerned to impose the disciplinary measures after a procedure that respects the defence either the ephedrine was taken to improve her performance or it is because she took some medicine legitimately to cure an infection however kuznetsova s naming was condemned by russian tennis chief shamil tarpishchev first of all this belgian sports minister has broken every ethical rule in the book by naming a player without any proof of wrongdoing without any basic evidence tarpishchev said we all know the basic principle in doping cases if there is a positive sample then they should notify the international tennis federation itf as well as the national federation within three days he said this is not the case here as of today we have not received any statement from the doping officials nor did the itf today i called the itf headquarters and they told me they know nothing about it if wada the world anti doping agency was behind the testing then we would also have known something by now otherwise all these looks to me as pure fiction and fabrication of the facts
