mcclaren hails boro s uefa spirit middlesbrough boss steve mcclaren has praised the way his side have got to grips with european football after the uefa cup win against lazio boro who are playing in europe for the first time in their year history are top of group e with maximum points i think we have taken to europe really well said mcclaren we got about lazio didn t let them settle or play and in possession we controlled it and looked threatening every time we went forward before the match mcclaren had said that a win over the italian giants would put boro firmly on the european footballing map and after they did just that he said it was a perfect european night for the team to give the fans a performance like that was the icing on the cake there have been many good performances but this was something special you can see that the experience we have in the squad is showing to win in europe you need to defend well and we have done that because we have conceded only one goal in four games we can also score goals and again that is something you can see from the performances we have had so we have good balance mcclaren s only criticism of his side was that their dominance should have been resulted in more goals it should have been more convincing said mcclaren but i had watched lazio in recent weeks and i saw them score a late equaliser against inter milan on saturday so i knew we needed a second goal no matter what anybody says lazio are favourites to win this competition middlesbrough forward boudewijn zenden said he did not expect such a comfortable match after he scored both goals we didn t expect it to be that one sided said zenden we did quite well in the first half we pressured them and they didn t cope with that i think we played quite well and it was a very good game especially in the first half the holland international said boro are confident of progressing in the competition after winning their first two group games we ve got a very good feeling there is a good spirit all the lads work hard for each other and it s a squad of friendly players which i think you can see on the pitch he added
