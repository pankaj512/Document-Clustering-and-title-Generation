farrell saga to drag on lindsay wigan chairman maurice lindsay says he does not expect a quick solution to the on going saga of captain andy farrell s possible switch to rugby union leicester and saracens are leading the chase for the player but lindsay told the bbc it was not yet a done deal as well as the rugby football union the league the individual club and the england coaching team have a say so it s not a quick decision he said he s given us years service so if he wants to go we d support him the prospect of farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the super league season so far it came as a bolt out of the blue to us admitted lindsay but he s a very loyal friend to the club so there s no question that he s deserting us he just fancies a challenge although the move would be a lucrative one for both farrell and wigan lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club the money side of things hasn t been concluded but it s not the point for wigan he told radio five live a shortage of money has never been a problem for us even if we did have it under the salary cap we can t spend a penny of it anyway we d rather have the player lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up farrell it d be a great loss for us but a great boost for them said the warriors chief this guy is an absolute sporting icon he s been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport athletes like him ellery hanley and martin johnson don t come along very often you re very lucky to have them whilst you ve got them
