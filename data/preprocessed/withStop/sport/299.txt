robinson ready for difficult task england coach andy robinson faces the first major test of his tenure as he tries to get back to winning ways after the six nations defeat by wales robinson is likely to make changes in the back row and centre after the loss as he contemplates sunday s set to with france at twickenham lewis moody and martin corry could both return after missing the game with hamstring and shoulder problems and the midfield pairing of mathew tait and jamie noon is also under threat olly barkley immediately allowed england to generate better field position with his kicking game after replacing debutant tait just before the hour the bath fly half cum centre is likely to start against france with either tait or noon dropping out tait given little opportunity to shine in attack received praise from robinson afterwards even if the coach admitted cardiff was an unforgiving place for the teenage prodigy robinson now has a tricky decision over whether to withdraw from the firing line after just one outing a player he regards as central to england s future tait himself at least outwardly appeared unaffected by the punishing treatment dished out to him by gavin henson in particular i want more of that definitely he said hopefully i can train hard this week and get selected for next week but we ll have to look at the video and wait and see we were playing on our own for a lot of the first half so it was quite difficult i thought we defended reasonably well but we ve just got to pick it up for france his newcastle team mate noon hardly covered himself in glory in his first major test he missed a tackle on michael owen in the build up to wales try conceded a penalty at the breakdown was turned over in another tackle and fumbled gavin henson s cross kick into touch all inside the first quarter his contribution improved in the second half but england clearly need more of a playmaker in the inside centre role up front the line out remains fallible despite a superb performance from chris jones whose athleticism came to the fore after stepping into the side for moody it is more likely the leicester flanker will return on the open side for the more physical challenge posed by the french forwards with andy hazell likely to make way lock ben kay also justified his recall with an impressive all round display on his return to the side but elsewhere england positives were thin on the ground
