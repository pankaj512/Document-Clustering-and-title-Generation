o sullivan keeps his powder dry when you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential ireland coach eddie o sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run up to this season s six nations championship he decreed after the world cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year that became a reality at the end of last summer with a week period at the start of the this season it may have annoyed his scottish and in particularly welsh cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the celtic league we will say nothing of mike ruddock poaching eight of the dragons side that faced leinster on sunday but like o sullivan he was well within his rights particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it the irfu has thrown their weight behind o sullivan who must be glad that in the main there is centrally controlled contracts bar keith gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg everyone of o sullivan s squad is fit fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season s campaign but i doubt whether o sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players he is not that sort of person however he may look at the overworked and injury hit england wales and france squads whose players have been overworked and then pat himself on the back for his foresight but there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game already ireland are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season a first grand slam since karl mullen s led the team to a clean sweep in with england and france visiting lansdowne road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down everything looks perfectly placed but in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any irishman under the burden of great expectations ireland have crumpled take the triple crown winning side of under mick doyle they were expected to up the ante further for a grand slam only the second in ireland s history what happened in whitewashed you see ireland in any sport love to be downsized then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary it is the nature of the beast but o sullivan s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season after their first triple crown for years they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder o sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players and they have repaid him in spades and there is more to come he has some old dogs in his squad but he will come to this season s championship with a different box of tricks and a new verve to succeed ireland can indeed succeed but just whisper it
