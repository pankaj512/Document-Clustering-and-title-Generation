radcliffe proves doubters wrong this won t go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula s career but as a test of character it was the toughest race she s ever taken part in a win in the new york marathon doesn t make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year if paula s last experience of the year had been athens it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future even if she d lost this race there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it she knows she can dig deep if she needs to it was a strong field with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning and although two hours minutes wasn t one of paula s best times it wasn t far off the record on a difficult course i was speaking to paula in the lead up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no win situation she thought that if she won people would say why couldn t she do that in athens and if she lost people would say her career was over and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race as she did in the marathon and m in athens but that was never on the cards she might have been beaten but she would have kept running the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens the niggling injuries her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions weren t at play here the only question was what position she could finish in most important of all despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race there were never doubts in paula s mind if she wasn t confident she wouldn t have run after all if you re the best in the world at an event you ll always have expectations of winning now paula will take part in the run london km race in london at the end of the year have a well earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism
