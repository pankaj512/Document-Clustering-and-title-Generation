mourinho receives robson warning sir bobby robson has offered chelsea boss jose mourinho some advice on coping under pressure the pair worked together at barcelona and porto and robson had a word of warning for his protege it has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose said robson it is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn and he ll get it straight robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of newcastle jose is doing very well at the moment robson added of the man who worked for him for six years he has got one pot possibly two to follow a big game against barcelona to come and i cannot see them losing their lead in the premiership they are in a good position and i would expect them to go on and win it which is a wonderful achievement what has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future if he is intelligent he will take it on board and he is very intelligent he will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months before that it was all about winning robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against mourinho i am not in a hurry to take the wrong job but i am ready to take the right job and i feel there is another job in me he added i know the area i am capable of working in and of course i would like a job in the premiership if one was available it would not worry me if i had to pit my wits against jose but it is not just a case of him and me against one another it would be his team against my team but i would not be afraid of that
