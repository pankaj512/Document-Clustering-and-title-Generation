murphy that was a bruising battle that s what i call a tough game it was very physical and fair play to the italians they made us work very hard for our victory their organisation was very very good and they proved again that they are getting better and better as the years go by it is by far the strongest italian team that we have faced we knew all along that we would be a huge threat particularly the first game in the championship it was not like the days gone by when you could get scores on the board early we had to work our socks off and try and build our scores gradually it was really hard work out there and the players have plenty of bumps and bruises to prove it i m not too bad but there are one or two others who will be feeling it a bit on monday morning in the backs we were not frustrated at such but the new rucking laws were a little bit problematical the different interpretations between the referee and the players was a little difficult but we managed to get the ball in our hands and i got a try near the end of the first half it s always good to score it was great work by brian and i always knew i had scored even though it went upstairs to the video referee eddie o sullivan was very calm at half time even though we were only ahead he spelled out what we needed to do and advocated getting the ball out of our own territory that new ruck law made it a bit more difficult to get out of our own half we were penalised a lot at the breakdown and if they had kicked all their chances at goal we would have been behind at the break so really we went back to playing a territory game and simplifying things and having more patience on the ball every one was a little down after the game following the injuries to brian and gordon as yet we do not know the full extent of the injuries but it does not that good now we have to focus on scotland and only six days to recover it s a big ask after such a bruising encounter i was very impressed the way the scots played against the french on saturday it could so easily have gone their way but for a couple of decisions we will be under no illusions it is going to be tough for us in the meantime when in rome
