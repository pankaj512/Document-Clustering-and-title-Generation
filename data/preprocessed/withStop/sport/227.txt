wenger keeping faith with almunia arsene wenger has pledged to keep faith with stand in keeper manuel almunia for the crunch week which could define arsenal s season almunia will start tuesday s champions league group tie against rosenborg and is likely to face chelsea on sunday wenger said you don t think i would take out one goalkeeper for just one game do you i don t do that i have to give him a run for a few games it s just that i don t want to make this story bigger than it is wenger insists he has complete faith in the year old spaniard who was signed last summer from celta vigo as back up to jens lehmann if you look at my career you will see that i have left many big players out for a long time i ve done it with dennis bergkamp kanu everybody it s because it s a goalkeeper that s all it s a usual situation for me you put your best team out no matter who it is for me it was not a big mistake at old trafford and i wasn t alarmed by what happened against birmingham either it s nothing against lehmann i think he s a great keeper as is almunia you can only play one of them these people are not robots they have good periods and less good periods just because lehmann doesn t play for two or three weeks or longer or shorter it doesn t mean i ve lost faith in him but former arsenal keeper david seaman believes lehmann has been harshly treated seaman told the daily mail jens is a fantastic keeper he deserves another chance he has made a few mistakes but on form he deserves to be the first team choice with arsenal hit by injuries and suspension inexperienced midfield pair of mathieu flamini and cesc fabregas will line up against rosenborg but wenger is confident they will prove more than capable it puts a lot of pressure on them but it s a good learning process said wenger i m not worried as they are both mentally strong and will put in the needed workrate the gunners go into the game boosted by the news that defender sol campbell is on the verge of signing a new deal with the club and the year old whose current contract runs out in the summer has made it clear he is determined to achieve champions league success with arsenal campbell said it means a lot to me to go through it s everything we want to carry on in this competition that s where the best teams in europe are to be in there playing against these guys and trying to win the trophy is the first thing in my mind meanwhile thierry henry believes he will be blamed if arsenal fail to qualify for the next stage of the champions league henry will captain the side in place of the suspended patrick vieira as the gunners seek the required victory over rosenborg and the striker said if we don t win and we go out of the competition like it or not it s going to be my fault that s the way it is if the team don t win i know i will be criticised no matter how i play
