corry backs skipper robinson england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways after losses to wales and france critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full back but corry has backed robinson who was given the role after the injury to fly half jonny wilkinson ahead of this weekend s trip to ireland jason is doing a tremendous job every week my respect for him goes up corry told bbc radio five live he is an inspirational captain when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense the players have a lot of respect for him it s an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest there is apprehension going into every game he added but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset when the whistle goes on sunday what has happened in the past does not count for anything we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game he said the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide if you look at the team on paper they have stars from one to it s a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage
