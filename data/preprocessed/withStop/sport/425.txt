federer claims dubai crown world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed in the first set but ljubicic who beat tim henman in the last eight dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool though turning on the style to win the deciding set the match was a re run of last week s final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam where federer triumphed but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets i really wanted to get off to a good start this time and i did and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm federer said that took me all the way through to on his serve and i almost ran away with it but he came back and that was a good effort on his side ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set i didn t start badly but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much and with roger if you relax for a second it just goes very quick he said after those first three games it was no match at all i don t know it was really weird i was playing really well the whole year and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court but despite his defeat the world number was pleased with his overall performance i had a chance in the third and for me it s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match it s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that i m up there and belong with top class players
