multi purpose tv aids india two thirds of the world s population billion people live on a year or less you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer but that s not the case many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv and now an indian born computer engineer thinks he s come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might i come from a village says prof reddy i know what the population is like many of them are illiterate and many of them have other concerns there nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a pc word processing and powerpoint he said so it s clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment education telemedicine and access to expert advice prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach after all he asked what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to million less fortunate indians let alone the billions of poor people around the world instead prof reddy decided to think of those million indians as a potential market the problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this prof reddy says people do this today with television sets if you go to india and many other countries they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal why because personalized entertainment has become very important this hatched a completely new idea he calls it a pctvt a personal computer television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control on the screen pictures not words designate applications like tv voice mail and video e mail this dependence on graphics video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs times more power and more memory than one for a phd prassana rambathla one of prof reddy s graduate students says that when you re talking illiterate you re talking audio and video and that demands exponentially high bandwidth it can t choke at any point in time and it has to withstand anything no matter what you re pressing the major part is making it foolproof very tough so that it never breaks he says the carnegie mellon team says this project is only possible because pcs are now so much cheaper and have built in audio and video hardware and software limited trials of the pctvt are due to start this month in the indian state of andhra pradesh although andhra pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley the answer says prof brewer is wi fi we re looking at the thing you ll see in starbuck s or many other hotspots he says we re doing a lot of work on long distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency when the power goes up and down and the links go up and down and the computers you re connected to just get turned off for no reason prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about a month and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt s other technologies such as video mail for example a farmer could use the pctvt s webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay off the underlying problem he says is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy and improve their health care and what i m postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them if i didn t have it it would be an uphill battle even with the technology it s an uphill battle but i have a tool there is hope i can reach them in ways that have not been possible before clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
