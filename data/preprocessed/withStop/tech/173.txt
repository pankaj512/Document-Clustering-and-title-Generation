supercomputer breaks speed record the us is poised to push japan off the top of the supercomputing chart with ibm s prototype blue gene l machine it is being assembled for the lawrence livermore national laboratory a us department of energy doe lab doe test results show that blue gene l has managed speeds of teraflops the current top machine japan s nec earth simulator clocks up due next week the top list officially charts the fastest computers in the world it is announced every six months and is worked out using an officially recognised mathematical speed test called linpack which measures calculations per second the speeds will most likely make it the fastest computer system on the planet yet the chip technology powering the machine is the kind which can be found in familiar devices such as games consoles the us secretary of energy spencer abraham confirmed that the machine had reached the breakneck speed according to the linpack benchmark until the official list is published however blue gene l s position will not be confirmed and there are expected to be some other new entries but the test results raise the bar of supercomputing enormously and signal a remarkable achievement surpassing the trillion calculations per second teraflop mark has been considered a landmark for some time the ibm blue gene l is only a prototype and is one th the speed of the full version due to be completed for the livermore labs in its peak theoretical performance is expected to be teraflops and will fit into full racks it will also cut down on the amount of heat generated by the massive power a big problem for supercomputers the final machine will help scientists work out the safety security and reliability requirements for the us s nuclear weapons stockpile without the need for underground nuclear testing the earth simulator has held on to the top spot since june it is dedicated to climate modelling and simulating seismic activity but in september ibm said that another blue gene l machine clocked up teraflops marginally surpassing the earth simulator s performance this was achieved during internal testing at ibm s production facility in rochester minnesota though so was not an official record another giant to enter the fray is silicon graphics columbia supercomputer based at nasa s ames research center in california it would be used to model flight missions climate research and aerospace engineering the linux based machine was reported to have reached a top speed of teraflops in october supercomputers are hugely important for working out very complex problems across science and society their massive simulation and processing power means they can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts help design better cars and improve disease diagnosis ibm s senior vice president of technology and manufacturing nick donofrio believes that by blue gene will be capable of petaflop computing this means it would be capable of doing trillion operations a second when you get a computer as large as a petaflop you can start to think of simulations that might complement the physical world mr donofrio recently told the bbc news website you can start to be more proactive more interactive and more innovative one area where mr donofrio sees supercomputing and blue gene machines in particular as crucial is health he believes the machines can help scientists understand one of the greatest challenges of the st century protein folding health is one of the most important problems not just mapping the human genome but also protein structures we are a great believer in simulation it gives you another tool he said once the structures of proteins are understood fully then drugs can be tailor made to fight diseases more effectively compared with the current fastest supercomputers blue gene is designed to consume one th the power and be times more compact since the first supercomputer the cray was installed at los alamos national laboratory in computational speed has leaped times the cray was capable of megaflops million operations a second the blue gene l machine that will be completed next year will be five million times faster started in the top list is decided by a group of computer science academics from around the world it is presented at the international supercomputer conference in pittsburgh
