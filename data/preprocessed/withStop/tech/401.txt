losing yourself in online gaming online role playing games are time consuming but enthralling flights from reality but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight and to offer a warning an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair keep track of time wrote travis anderson in texas some of the comments were humorous this game is so good i m not going to get it there s no way i could limit the hours i d spend playing it wrote charles macintyre from england but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game mmorpg you need to get out more could be the motto of any mmorpg shame they are getting more popular as you know this problem is just going to mushroom wrote stuart stanton davies in huddersfield scare mongering articles about addictive video games have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices gaming is like any other pastime it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession whether it is spending too much time in the gym in front of the television or reading poetry unfortunately gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make however stories about gamers spending to hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some massively multiplayer online role playing games mmorpgs allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds the scope of these games like warcraft everquest ultima among others is epic and exploration and adventure is almost infinite part of the problem is grinding by which gamers have to perform long winded mindless tasks to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure such open endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing not for no reason is everquest eq nicknamed evercrack e hayot writing in the culture blogzine print culture said recently i used to play the online role playing game everquest a lot by a lot i mean probably to hours a week on average and on weeks where i didn t have to work as many as or hours he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour wasn t that unusual lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much you lie you don t go into work because you had stuff to do at home you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner you spend much less time watching tv a good thing presumably he wrote explaining how everquest took over his time he quit the game he says because he realised life was more fun than everquest let us be clear such obsession is rare but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far almost people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month only a fraction will descend into obsessives the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind jane who runs the website compiles a chronicle of heart rending stories i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than some people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality she said one unnamed correspondent all are anonymous wrote on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me i can t talk to him while he is playing there is absolutely no point as he doesn t hear me or is so distracted that i get a ummm ya a few minutes after i ask him a question gaming widows has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers but for some it is not in the least funny another correspondent wrote i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness and some of them are even sadder today our son was five days old the sad truth is my husband spent hours today playing his warcraft game he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream and games ever more immersive there will be no hiding place for social problems i wish hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isn t an hour stretch isn t that surprising i ve known people to play hours at a stretch i know of people who are spending their week s holiday from work playing warcraft i know of people who would play ever crack in shifts waking at am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they needed to appear i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life by all standards many of us are addicts so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming i find myself longing to have the time to join them i have been in a long term relationship for over years since that began games have become more and more complex and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct i play games a lot definately over hours a week but i don t go missing work or other commitments in order to play games i have about a year ago deleted every game on my computer rpgs are the worst the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword unlike books or perhaps even tv you gain absolutely nothing when you stop playing you re at the same point as when you started all the achievements of your hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and since you ve gained nothing in the real world you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one despite having little monetary value the rewards and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality my advice to gaming widows is if you can t beat em join em that is try playing it yourself if he wants to play as well well at least you ll be together somewhere i was an addict and it cost me my relationship i still play now but without the guilt hehe how long have i played in one sitting from morning till the early hours of the next day the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain i would hardly eat perhaps some toast smoke endlessly and drink now thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate obsessive behaviour is of course always cause for concern but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of reality obviously somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem this problem however has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be real any more than for example an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human if mmorpgs have a unique danger in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world but rather that they can be easily accessed the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming but with the nature of modern hour culture the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them there s always another quest to do a few of my friends have only had about hours sleep since it was released friday championship manager consumed my life for years one particular session started at about pm on a sunday paused for a brief sleep at am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another hour session the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of hardcore gaming seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did others were less fortunate and dropped out of college now that i am holding a job i avoid online rpgs like the plague when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from am till pm when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well hence justifying playing it all evening i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i m trying not to spend so much time on there it s not easy i feel as if i ve got a real addiction going on here for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal once it is completed that is it i am finished time to move on i become obsessed to complete the goal so from that standpoint it is an addiction in a game where you will never complete an ultimate goal well it would be like falling into a black pit it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times in other words the goal offered in the pc game are easier and more fun than the real world pretty scary implications if you think about it i can t buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage i just know it i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly but this progress becomes exponentially slower requiring more and more time to reach the next level i m sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor slowly building up my character stopping only for food and toilet breaks thankfully i made a clean break and actually managed to sell my jedi account for which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum seven years ago i began playing ultima online this game dominated years of my life they were wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year building up my stats completing evermore quests and battling ogres but somehow i found time to get out even met someone and got married has my life changed hell no i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning on with the fun online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families relationships and good careers a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs the message to the government is clear either legalise drugs or outlaw online gaming sounds like there are some sad stories here and i can believe them all i play alot of warcraft myself and know full well how addictive it is i am resolute that it will not take over my life it certainly gets in the way though i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it i think i m obsessed with gaming in general i spend far too much time playing games like everquest and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to i m always thinking in the back if my mind that i d rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united i am obsessed with online role playing games it s not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation goals to achieve etc i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect whereas other games and some other pursuits such as being a couch potato the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature these games are like most things too much of anything is a bad thing but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too they can be great fun living in korea at the moment they have lots pc bangs internet cafes nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games i play xbox live every day i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix the longest i played was a hour straight session i know i play for to long but it s an obsession that i can t control can you reccomend a counsellor this is not a wind up but something i m increasingly concerned with me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day we re both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv trying to frag some individual it s getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming and enjoying real life i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out the longest period i played was hrs straight i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive but have subsequently just bought the european version couldn t help myself in future i m going to regulate my time far more strictly great game having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person s health you can expect this not to decline but to get worse these people are pathetic they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and online universe absolutely meaningless hours when i was a kid at school and i was on half term ultima online was the game ahhhh them was the days lol
