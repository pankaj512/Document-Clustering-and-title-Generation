peer to peer nets here to stay peer to peer p p networks are here to stay and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms says a panel of industry experts once several high profile legal cases against file sharers are resolved this year firms will be very keen to try and make money from p p technology the expert panel probed the future of p p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january the first convictions for p p piracy were handed out in the us in january william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music movies and software since the first successful file sharing network napster was forced to close down the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p p technology blaming it for falling sales and piracy but that is going to change very soon according to the panel the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p p networks which are not illegal in themselves and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks but they have slowly realised that p p is a good way to distribute content said travis kalanick founder and chairman of p p network red swoosh and soon they are all going to want a slice of it they are just waiting to come up with business models that work for them which includes digital rights management and copy protection standards but until the legal actions are resolved experimentation with p p cannot not happen said michael weiss president of streamcast networks remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out mr weiss said old media always tries to stop new media when they can t stop it they try to control it then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business in august the san francisco based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast two file sharing networks the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the s vcr battle and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal p p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files instead it uses direct connections between computers or clients there are now many different types of p p systems than work in different ways p p nets can be used to share any kind of file like photos free software licensed music and any other digital content the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p p technology to distribute them the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many the global entertainment industry says more than billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month and about half a million films are downloaded a day legal music download services like apple itunes napster have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file sharers away from free content sales of legally downloaded songs grew tenfold in with million tracks bought online in the us and europe in months the ifpi reported this week but such download services are very different from p p networks not least because of the financial aspect there are several money spinning models that could turn p p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies paid for pass along in which firms receive money each time a file is shared along with various drm solutions and advertiser based options are all being considered we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p p said marc morgenstern vice president of anti piracy firm overpeer consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together agreed mr morgenstern but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry s potential controlling grip on content and p p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations unsigned bands for example use p p networks to distribute their music effectively which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign increasingly what you are seeing on p p is consumer created content said derek broes from microsoft they will probably play an increasing role in helping p p spread he said looking into p p s future file sharing is just the beginning for p p networks as far as mr broes is concerned once some of these issues are resolved you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content but also in ways that are unimaginable now he said file sharing is the tip of the iceberg
