text messages aid disaster recovery text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television the blogging world though might know him better by his online name morquendi he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast cell phone signals were weak land lines were unreliable so mr senanayake started sending out text messages the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on the ground assessment of who needs what and where blogging friends in india took mr senanayake s text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent and that s when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call he says in every rural community there s at least one person who has access to a mobile phone or has a mobile phone and can receive messages half a world away in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago taran rampersad read morquendi s messages mr rampersad who used to work in the military knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help mr rampersad said imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets and had a central place to send a text message to that effect he can message the server so the server can send out an e mail message and human or machine moderators can e mail aid agencies and get it out in the field he added or send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region and they might have an excess of it and be able to shift supplies to the right places mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september last week he sent out e mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia in only hours he found dan lane a text message guru living in britain the pair along with a group of dedicated techies are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache the idea is to use open source software software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint and a far flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people says paul saffo a director at the california based institute for the future you may be halfway around the world from someone but in cyberspace you re just one click or one e mail away he said that s put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they re not right on top of the tragedy it is still very early days for the project though in an e mail dan lane calls it an early proof of concept right now the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web page or distribute it to an e mail list in the near future the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages but there s still another challenge you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use it s amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to and say look this is what we re trying to do and everything like that says mr rampersad so the big problem right now is the same problem we re trying to solve human communication he is optimistic however he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments too will sit up and take notice and he stands by his motto courtesy of michelangelo criticise by creating clark boyd is technology correspondent for the world a bbc world service and wgbh boston co production
