apple laptop is greatest gadget the apple powerbook has been chosen as the greatest gadget of all time by us magazine mobile pc the laptop was chosen because it was one of the first lightweight portable computers and helped define the layout of all future notebook pcs the magazine has compiled an all time top list of gadgets which includes the sony walkman at number three and the zenith remote control at two gadgets needed moving parts and or electronics to warrant inclusion the magazine staff compiled the list and specified that gadgets also needed to be a self contained apparatus that can be used on its own not a subset of another device in general we included only items that were potentially mobile said the magazine in the end we tried to get to the heart of what really makes a gadget a gadget it concluded the oldest gadget in the top is the abacus which the magazine dates at a d and put in th place other pre electronic gadgets in the top include the sextant from th position the marine chronometer from nd position and the kodak brownie camera from th position the tivo personal video recorder is the newest device to make the top which also includes the first flash mp player diamond multimedia as well as the first successful digital camera casio qv and mobile phone motorola startac the most popular gadget of the moment the apple ipod is at number in the list while the first sony transistor radio is at number sony s third entry in the top is the cdp cd player from who can forget the crystalline hiss free blast of madonna s like a virgin emanating from their first cd player asked the magazine karl elsener s knife the swiss army knife from is at number in the list gadgets which could be said to feature surprisingly low down in the list include the original telephone rd the nintendo gameboy th and the pulsar quartz digital watch th the list also contains plenty of oddities the pez sweet dispenser th s toy tamagotchi th and the bizarre ronco inside the shell egg scrambler th almost everyone has a mobile phone how many people own a powerbook or an ipod the findings of this magazine are not very convincing what about the magnetic compass we still use it years after it was invented i am amazed by the obsession with individual gadgets rather than genre for example the sony walkman was the first truly portable way of listening to your own music on the move whereas minidisc flash mp portable cd players etc are really just improvements in technology my favourite true gadgets are probably my portable minidisc player and the little battery powered whizzy thing i use to froth up my coffee calm down it s only in their opinion and any list that includes the taser in the top gadgets has to be suspect swiss army knife and no question about it how many of the other items are still relatively unchanged from the original idea and still as useful popular you don t need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to work that one out this list merely illustrates interesting cultural divides between the american authors and the overwhelmingly british responses brits see no further than mobile phones and the over thirties sinclair whilst the americans focus on apple tv remotes and tivo which probably is rather obscure in europe what about the soda stream this gadget changed my pre teen life lap tops may enable you to think different but you cant use them to get busy with the fizzy how about astro wars one of the pioneers for computer games i remember spending many an hour playing this and it still works today however tried it the other day and it was rubbish still a great gadget of its time why worry about mobile phones soon they will be subsumed into the pda s laptops etc what about the marine chronometer completely revolutionised navigation for boats and was in use for centuries for it s time a technological marvel sony net minidisc it paved the way for more mp player to explode onto the market i always used my netmd and could not go anywhere without it a laptop computer is not a gadget it s a working tool the sinclair executive was the world s first pocket calculator i think this should be there as well how about the clockwork radio or gps or a pocket calculator all these things are useful to real people not just pc magazine editors are the people who created this list insane surely the most important gadget of the modern age is the mobile phone it has revolutionised communication which is more than can be said for a niche market laptop from outside the modern age the marine chronometer is the single most important gadget without which modern transportation systems would not have evolved so quickly has everyone forgot about the breville pie maker an interesting list of the electronic gadgets thousands of journalists in the early s blessed the original noteboook pc the tandy the size of a paper and light three weeks on a set of batteries an excellent keyboard a modem a pity tandy did not make it dos compatible what s an apple powerbook it s out of date not much of a gadget surely it has to be something simple timeless the tin opener swiss army knife safety razor blade wristwatch or the thing for taking stones out of horses hooves it has to be the mobile phone no other single device has had such an effect on our way of living in such a short space of time the ball point pen has got to be one of the most used and common gadgets ever also many might be grateful for the pocket calculator which was a great improvement over the slide rule the casio pocket calculator that played a simple game and made tinny noises was also a hot gadget in a true gadget it could be carried around and shown off all top are electronic toys so the list is probably a better reflection of the current high tech obsession than anything else i say this as the swiss army knife only made no sinclair ql a machine far ahead of its time the first home machine with a true multi takings os shame the marketing was so bad apple a triumph of fashion over well everything else utter rubbish yes the apple laptop and sony walkman are classic gadgets but to call the sextant and the marine chronometer gadgets and rank them as less important than a tv remote control reveals a quite shocking lack of historical perspective the former literally helped change the world by vastly improving navigation at see the latter is the seed around which the couch potato culture has developed no competition i d also put apple s newton and the first palm pilot there as the front runners for portable computing and possibly the toshiba libretto for the same reason i only wish that vulcan inc s flipstart wasn t just vapourware otherwise it would be at the top how did a laptop ever manage to beat off the challenge of the wristwatch or the telephone mobile or otherwise what about radios and tvs the swiss army knife by far the most useful gadget i got mine years ago still wearing and using it a lot it stood the test of time psion organiser series should be up there had a usable qwerty keyboard removable storage good set of apps and programmable case design was good batteries in the hinge a first i think great product innovation the first mobile pc was voted best gadget by readers of err mobile pc why do you keep putting these obviously biased lists on your site it s obviously the mobile phone or remote control and readers of a less partisan publication would tell you that the motorola startac should be number one why there will be mobile phones long after notebook computers and other gadgets are either gone or integrated in communications devices the psion series c the first most practical way to carry all your info around i too would back the sinclair spectrum without this little beauty i would never have moved into the world of it and earn the living that i do now i d have put the mobile phone high up the list probably a nokia model sinclair spectrum k it plugged into the tv games were rubbish but it gave me a taste for programming and that s what i do for a living now i wish more modern notebooks even apple s newest offerings were more like the pb particularly disheartening is the demise of the trackball which has given way to the largely useless trackpad which every notebook on the market today uses they re invariably inaccurate uncomfortable and cumbersome to use congratulations to apple a deserved win
