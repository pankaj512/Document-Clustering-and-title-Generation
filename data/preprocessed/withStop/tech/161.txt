when technology gets personal in whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists or other parts of the body says ian pearson bt s resident futurologist it s all part of what s known as a pervasive ambient world where chips are everywhere mr pearson does not have a crystal ball his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now to guide industries into the future inanimate objects will start to interact with us we will be surrounded on streets in homes in appliances on our bodies and possibly in our heads by things that think forget local area networks these will be body area networks ideas about just how smart small or even invisible technology will get are always floating around images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology but now a new vision is surfacing where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality form or aesthetics such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed so mp players the mass gadget of the moment will disappear and instead become integrated into one s clothing says mr pearson so the gadgets that fill up your handbag when we integrate those into fabric we can actually get rid of all that stuff you won t necessarily see the electronics wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up while video tattoos or intelligent electronic contact lenses might function as tv screens for those on the move however this future of highly personal devices where technology is worn or even fuses with the body itself raises ethical questions if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing jewellery and skin there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans says baroness susan greenfield at a recent conference for technology engineering academic and fashion industry experts at the royal society in london neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we can t just sleepwalk into the future yet this technology is already upon us researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing mp jackets based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves have already appeared in shops these smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano and micro engineering the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale at the nanoscale materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster lighter stronger and more efficient devices and systems the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine defence healthcare sports and communications professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin nanoscale titanium dioxide tio coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti odour properties these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance to turn airline seats into super stain resistant surfaces and applied to windows so they clean themselves dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being if our clothing skin and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring everywhere we go we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy mr pearson picks up the theme pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become cyborgian his main concern is privacy we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don t want every passer by to know so we have to make sure we build security in this if you are wearing smart make up where electronics are controlling the appearance you don t want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead as technology infiltrates our biology how will our brains function differently we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this warns baroness greenfield there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers clearly the organic carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging the cyborg a very familiar part human part inorganic science fiction and academic idea is on its way
