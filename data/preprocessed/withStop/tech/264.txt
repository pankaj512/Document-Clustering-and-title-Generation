broadband soars in if broadband were a jumbo jet then would have seen it taxiing down the runway firing up its engines and preparing for take off but this year has seen it soar in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology rather than how useful sky high broadband would actually be it was flying high and by the autumn five million britons had signed up for high speed net access at home such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million or more than of homes the two key factors in whetting people s appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard k broadband for less than at the beginning of the year it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached broadband had truly gone mass market a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take up of dial up broadband for less than was even touted by some firms although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models for those who became broadbanders in there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access to the tune of million connections worldwide by april prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever by september the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every seconds broadband was being mentioned on the o clock news and in the tabloids the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines in may bt quietly announced that it was shaving off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges so called local loop unbundling the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes with cheaper local loop unbundling rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise like it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to mb megabits per second and the major price fall means that rather than just talk about it companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt s exchanges it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks fraught bitter and with no end in sight another big piece of news for broadband users in was the extension of bt s reach meaning more than of the population could get broadband regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to mbps broadband they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband enabled exchange for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology the news meant they could finally join in broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year the biggest news for them was increased speeds introducing mb and mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on k the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route broadband can seem confusing for consumers with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set up fees it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in but remains a plane worth catching as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride
