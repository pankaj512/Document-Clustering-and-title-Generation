podcasters look to net money nasa is doing it year old boys in bedrooms are doing it couples are doing it gadget lovers male and female are definitely doing it it is podcasting diy radio in the form of downloadable mp audio files they can done by anyone who has a microphone simple software the net and something to say some liken them to talking audioblogs because many complement text based weblogs diary like sites where people share their thoughts they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net on demand and the movement is at very early stages it s about real people saying real things and communicating says adam curry former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting he was one of a community of people who created ipodder a small computer program known as an aggregator it collects and automatically sends mp files to any digital music playing device that can play wmp formats those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like and subscribe for free to that show s feed when a new podcast is available it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer it is totally going to kill the business model of radio thinks curry i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are he says and they are scared to death of the next generation like my daughter who is who don t listen to radio they are on msn they ve got their ipod their mp player they ve got their xbox they are not listening to radio so how are they going to reach these audiences it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it it is a fledgling movement but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it ian fogg jupiter research analyst thinks there could be potential for business but it could take an interesting turn if big companies like apple and microsoft get involved it is a nascent area but quite exciting it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over he says podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about a classic hybrid it is another aspect of the time shifting of content the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want when and wherever you want audiences are in the s s and s rather than millions more than podcasts are currently listed curry s daily source code which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community has s of thousands of listeners but dave winer is doubtful he designed the format called rss really simple syndication which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed he is also writer of the longest running weblog on the net scripting news he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential not in its over hyped business promise we re the sources the people doing stuff and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we re doing no matter how you look at it commercialising this medium isn t going to make very much money he says podcasting is going to be a medium of niches with audiences measured in the single digits like e mail or blogs maybe in a few years maybe six or seven digits but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon curry and associate ron bloom s new venture called podshow is to help ordinary people produce post distribute and market their podcasts because of the way podcasts work based on rss the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready made targets when you look at podcasting wow this is a pretty interesting audience the audience is pre selected they have decided to subscribe to your program explains curry advertising in his eyes can be tailored to podcasts to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive how i believe this will work is to create a network that in aggregation will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters i have listeners i could make a couple of bucks off that but not much if you are talking a million podcasters and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves then that is kind of interesting essentially he says if you are doing a bass fishing podcast someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show he is clear the ads will not be the traditional in your face type familiar to commercial radio now we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place it is happening already coffee loving curry has sold worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site others use in show promotions like the dawn and drew show one eric rice has won sponsorship from warner bros he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative one thing is for sure they are not about to disappear in a hurry the creative forces behind radio are elated says curry for now he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community i should be knighted for this he adds with a wry chuckle people are going to be so happy to sit at home make their podcast and make a little money
