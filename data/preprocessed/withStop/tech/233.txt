d metal slug offers retro fun like some drill sergeant from the past metal slug is a wake up call to today s gamers molly coddled with slick visuals and fancy trimmings with its hand animated sprites and d side scrolling this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year and yes that includes halo simply choose your grunt and wade through five d side scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter it is also the toughest game you are likely to play as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on players must battle soldiers snowmen zombies giant crabs and aliens not to mention the huge screen filling bosses that guard each of the five levels the shoot anything that moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old school genius fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers instead to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware tanks jets and submarines can be commandeered as well as cannon toting camels elephants and ostriches more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls and while this is a tough nut to crack it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go and at a mere metal slug is as cheap as sliced fried spuds as the man says of course most of you will ignore this lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation metal slug is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates eye
