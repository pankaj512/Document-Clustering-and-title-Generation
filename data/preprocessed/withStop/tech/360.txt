confusion over high definition tv now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv dvds and digital video recorders the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets in most corners of tv and technology industries high definition hdtv is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour hd essentially makes tv picture quality at least four times better than now but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street thousands of flat panel screens lcds liquid crystal displays plasma screens and dlp rear projection tv sets have already been sold as hd but are in fact not able to display hd the uk is the largest display market in europe according to john binks director of gfk which monitors global consumer markets but he added of all the flat panel screens sold just in the uk are capable of getting high definition there are different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd ready according to alexander oudendijk senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra they may be fantastic quality tvs but many do not have adaptors in them called dvi or hdmi high definition multimedia interface connectors which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street say industry experts who gathered at bafta in london for the nd european hdtv summit last week we have to be careful about consumer confusion there is a massive education process to go through said mr binks the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it eventually that will be everyone the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by preparations for the analogue switch off are already underway in some areas and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras bskyb plans to ship its first generation set top boxes to receive hdtv broadcasts in time for christmas like its sky boxes they will also be personal video recorders pvrs the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes offering them as premium channel packages concentrating to start with on sports big events and films in early but the set top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display tv set that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands if hdtv is to be real by of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to being digital as a result all the key players those who make flat panel displays as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters formed a hd forum in to make sure they were all talking to each other part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for from next month all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a hd ready sticker this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry the logo is absolutely the way forward said david mercer analysts with strategy analytics but it is still not appearing on many retail products the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help but it is only a start we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers said mr oudendijk there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months the european broadcast union ebu is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats as well as which devices will support the formats we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile said phil laven technical director for the ebu the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least in cm to get the true impact of hd they say although smaller displays suffice what may convince people to spend money on hd ready devices is the falling prices which continue to tumble across europe the prices are dropping an average of every year according to analysts lcd prices dropped by in europe as a whole last year according to mr oudendijk
