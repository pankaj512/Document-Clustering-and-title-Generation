solutions to net security fears fake bank e mails or phishing and stories about id theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce say e business experts trust in online security is falling as a result almost of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people the survey of more than people reported that were not willing to hand over personal information online it is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net more people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats said security firm rsa which carried out the poll an estimated million britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e commerce and e banking are being taken seriously by banks in particular i don t think the threat is overplayed barry beal global security manager for capgemini told the bbc news website he added the challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too as well as the individual and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud he said card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves if we do that they will indemnify us he said many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though one of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual s identity several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords which are easily compromised and easy to forget last year a street survey found that more than of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate on average people have to remember four different passwords some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer in a separate survey by rsa said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems for many the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard activcard is just one of the many companies like rsa security which has been trying to come up with just that rsa has a deal with internet provider aol that lets people pay monthly for a one time passcode generation service users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for seconds many companies use a token based method already for employees to access networks securely already activcard s method is more complex it is currently trailing its one time passcode generation technology with uk banks steve ash from activcard told the bbc news website there are two parts to the process of identification the most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online the end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both the method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time this can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as seconds before it changes it combines that with usual usernames and passwords as well as other security questions you take the card put it in the reader enter your pin number and a code is given if you wanted then to transfer funds for instance you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction the clever bit happens back at the bank s secure servers the code is validated by the bank s systems matching the information they expect with the customer s unique key each individual gets a key which is unique to them it is a bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack said mr ash it means that in a typical security attack explains mr ash even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites they need the passcode by the time they go back to use the information the code has expired so they can t prove who they are according to mr ash in the next few years mr ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use pcs will have readers built into them the cost of readers will be very cheap and more people will have the cards the gadgets we carry around like personal digital assistants pdas and mobiles could also have integrated card reader technology in them the pda or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around he said
