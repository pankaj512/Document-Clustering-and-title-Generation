brits debate over urban music joss stone a year old soul singer from devon beat dizzee rascal jamelia lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is i m not really comfortable with the word urban it s a word that s been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it s wrong how far are the brits removed from inner city music and what people are doing it s so far removed that i don t expect them to get it bang on the music industry isn t championing music from our particular genre very well anyway people don t feel like that s anything to do with us i don t feel like urban music s just been celebrated by joss stone winning or her being nominated or by the brits acknowledging that there s an urban music scene because it s all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day it s not really relevant if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she s signed to then so be it it s got nothing to do with what s really going on urban as a genre is very broad if you look underneath urban there are a number of core elements that include hip hop r b garage and into that obviously comes soul joss stone is a soul artist her first album was called the soul sessions so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub genres and there are offshoots of all of those joss stone has had amazing success in the us given that she s a uk artist what has really captured everybody s imagination is that here you have a year old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really really good tunes and she looks good i think that s what s done it the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base i don t think joss was not a worthy winner she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban the fact that she s from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she s literally rural the great thing about urban music is that there s a big range if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain i think that s where you can call it urban that s where this new sub category or uber category has come from joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer but you couldn t argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions it is coming from somewhere genuine it has to come across as real that s the only cut off point we have here and that s the only way by which we judge people what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi cultural britain then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too race doesn t make a difference if everyone is included out of all the awards dished out yesterday i m still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award a type of music especially street music that originates from a city and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life she might not be urban but when did r b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now r b stands for rhythm and blues remember that joss stone is rubbish is certain if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music i think probably should include hip hop soul funk at least but not rock or pop this year its the streets although dizzee rascal stakes a good claim she definitely deserved to win a prize joss stone s albums are quite simply amazing easily better than anything else that was released last year this whole debate about what is urban what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren t nominated or didn t win i cant see why people can t just congratulate her for the talent that she is she did deserve it but i agree with the comments about urban music its a stupid phrase and particularly british in the states they tend to use hip hop and r b if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what i m talking about very strange what s in a name a rose by any other name etc if people want to call it urban why not if we really analysed it the term dance music is misleading because it doesn t describe everything you can dance to whilst i agree that the term urban is open to interpretation it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won urban to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i ve been to good luck to joss stone let s celebrate her victory let s also question why with artists so successful and talented as jamelia lemar kanye west dizzee rascal alicia keys and outkast we didn t see a single black artist on stage collecting an award so what you re saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn t black and if it is then they shouldn t be acknowledged for it even if they re pretty dam good at it she s has an amazing voice and won good on her oh but she s not black well let s make her feel real bad about it then how dare she though hang on didn t the so called public vote on this one this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the s and s in relation to what jazz was the media then called anything that had a swinging beat syncopated melody or soulful feeling jazz much to the chagrin of the artists it would mean that blues would be put in the same mould as bebop cool and ragtime all very different styles at that time jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term and so what of urban music in truth it s a lazy term to categorise music that you don t really understand soul and garage are worlds apart musically marvin gaye v tuff jam but no doubt have their connections if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is rather than what it represents i demand a prize for rural music sucks to the cities it s way better out here we have hay for one thing excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely i dont understand the point that ty is making if lemar who makes music which is less soulful than joss work won he might have said nothing btw i m black too how can she be urban if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside nonsense i love joss to bits and don t care what her branding is it s amazing music full stop stop puting it all in brackets and let s just call it music and let s especially drop the black urban tag nearly all music came from black origin this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is historically considered urban music irrelevent of the colour of their skin or where they originate from joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style just as someone from an inner city and indeed not from the usa could sing country music if that person was good at it and authentic in sound would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed in part from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards the very term music of black origin has confused and offended many people this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards it appears that the use of black or white in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable the term urban therefore has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first black or white thereby rendering the issue colourblind the result is now a redundant new debate as to what urban also means perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul rnb and hip hop one which does not also mean something else as we have done with crunk urban is just a word that s come about recently to describe black music that s become popular now the word wasn t even in use or common use five of six years ago it s just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it i m in a band that has been called urban and i despise the label i d hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche because that s all it is ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider music of black origin these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity look at all the tv broadcasters unable to reach young people without condesending they simply play some urban music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music ignore the labels it is what it is just music as a black man i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives black people should lead the music they invented we should stop calling a genre meaningless northing is meaningless the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black same thing with streets amy winehouse etc who s ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson they are both times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos but why not brits so what if joss stone won the urban awards her music is great soul and surely that is under the urban banner what if the streets had won would people be whining because mike skinner is white it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else urban is pc version for saying black music i m not doubting ms stone s talent but why didn t jamelia or lemar get a brit this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past getting nominations are easy to get but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing refreshing to see people making reasonable intelligent comments on any topic these days more power to you people you have said it there is music you like and music you don t like who cares what label you put on it that entire category was a mess how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone its like putting eminem against bob geldof she should have been nominated for best british r b act joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents but i don t think it was very urban of her to sing angels with robbie williams urban is a nonsense term music of black origin well doesn t that include rock music made in the inner cities well almost all bands end up making music in london manchester etc and doesn t that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities it doesn t make any sense why does music have to be put into a genre it s music you like it or you don t simple as that i play in a heavy metal band we are urban music as far as i m concerned we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment it therefore directly shapes what we write musically urban seems to be the new name for all styles of black music why it needed a rebrand i don t know as the name is misleading oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know therefore more than fit the term urban yet as they re a white rock band they won t be described as such joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery what other reason do they need to award her the brit all this urban and other such categorisation is just the red tape of the music business and is best ignored yeah she deserved it she is talented urban is a crap meaningless politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though there s only two kinds of music good and bad
