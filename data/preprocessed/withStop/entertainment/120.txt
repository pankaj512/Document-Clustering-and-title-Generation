my memories of marley to mark the th anniversary of the birth of reggae star bob marley rob partridge marley s former head of press at island records remembers the man behind the legend partridge worked with marley from until the jamaican musician s death in i joined island records in and the first week i was there i worked on his show at the rainbow theatre it was one of the last dates he did in london the album exodus came out in and that provided five hits and confirmed his global superstar status by he was the biggest touring attraction in the world i remember going to see dates in milan and turin and they were enormous concerts bob was one of the most mesmeric people i ve ever had the privilege to work with he must have had an iron will to succeed bob was a very driven individual you realised from the start there was a manifest destiny within him that he believed in he didn t suffer fools gladly at the risk of stating the obvious he was an extraordinary song writer and his stage act was perhaps the greatest i ve ever seen i saw him many times i recall in he came to the uk for top of the pops and a daily mirror journalist did a half hour interview it was interrupted to do a rehearsal he came back into the dressing room to resume the interview but saw a world cup match on tv he sat down in front of the tv and after minutes it was obvious he wasn t going to move that was the end of it the mirror had a very truncated interview the last time i saw him was in london in i arranged for him to play four days of football indoors in fulham bob was a good player we are talking about jamaican style football he was an attacking midfield player his team assembled wherever his gigs were we played in brazil against some world cup winning players it was always a struggle for him to connect with black america reggae did not correspond with disco in the s but bob in the s became one of the great icons in america and the third world in ten years after his death he sold more records than at any time during his life we saw black america taking bob into their hearts for the first time bob in worldwide terms is the greatest music star there has ever been if you went to africa he would be recognised everywhere in places john lennon or elvis wouldn t be no disrespect to the other artists but a case can be made for him as the greatest the best and the most influential artist in popular music well was to be the year he toured africa with stevie wonder he had only performed in zimbabwe and guinea before of course the tour never happened but the whole of africa would have embraced him we can t speculate but he was at the height of his powers and just years old i had no sense his career was going to go downhill bob was endlessly optimistic about the way africa would turn out he realised that nothing was perfect but he had total belief in the power of mankind i m sure if he were alive today he would believe africa would firstly become politically free and secondly be able to defeat the aids epidemic the final tune of his final album was redemption song one of the most incredible classics of all time
