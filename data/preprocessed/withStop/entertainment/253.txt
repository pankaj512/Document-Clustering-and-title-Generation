published at the start of last year scissor sisters franz ferdinand keane joss stone and mcfly were all in the sound of top the other five brits winners were already established before sound of was compiled the ceremony will be televised on itv on thursday i m speechless best song of the last years yeah right i very much doubt that angels was even the best song of the week that it came out like every track robbie has released as a single it s a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before give us a break best song in years you must be joking its good if you like that sort of thing but really listened to angels on radio this morning when i was driving into work had not heard it for a while i love robs voice the lyrics and tune perfection as usual the public have short memories when it comes to voting for the greatest there must be more than a dozen songs in the last years that deserve this award more it s not exactly groundbreaking presumably the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low i m actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last years what about the specials ghost town the buzzcocks ever fallen in love with someone happy mondays kinky afro mcalmont butler yes joy division love will tear us apart angels is middle of the road rubbish angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap it s musically and lyrically inept and fantastically overrated a bit like mr williams himself this result isn t very surprising though the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music best of the last years maybe cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really not much competition in the last years after all it s alright for a pop song but the best song of the last years there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last years it s a travesty rubbish who voted it for it to be included in any list i am a regular listener to radio but i don t recall the invitation to vote for this bland slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn t know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last years how depressing and just when we thought manufactured pop was on the way out where on earth did this dreadful list appear from while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won in all seriousness i think that the best song of the last years should not include songs less than years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty then again well done robbie good show you ve got to be kidding angels is a great song but not the best song of the last years only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don t think its the best song from the past years right enough it is better than some of the others in this catergory for example what was will young doing being nominated in the first place he is alright but the song isn t that good i m happy for robbie himself though best song in the last years what a joke think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the s and pretty much all of them are better than angels phil collins doesn t deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote angels is an overrated song that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it soppy rubbish at best hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today for me it s proof that music and democracy just don t mix still at least it wasn t will young oh it s all just a bit of fun people take these awards too seriously robbie has millions of loyal fans while even non fans know the words to angels him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards personally i wanted will young to win but that was not really due to his musical talent i hate the song all it brings back is memories of school discos and no one to slow dance with i agree about angels i never get fed up hearing it whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up smile and sing along very badly that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out the song makes me calm and serene and happy well done robbie i think that although robbie williams is a good performer that angels isn t really that good a song it certainly isn t anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush angels is a fantastic song all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers it s a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups robbie did in no way deserve that mantle whenever we have these awards it is always artists from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best we forget about the late s and early s for example they weren t cool at the time but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think yes angels is the best song since the past years because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning i ve always disliked angels intensely i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre teens teens and middle aged women to accept low quality low aspirational music as classic songwriting it s orrible it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don t particularly like music all that much folks without collections folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music angels adds nothing it is merely an irritating distraction a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer s afternoon picnic what a dreadful result if you voted for it you should feel ashamed of yourself you probably only know a dozen songs or so don t you so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote booo hisss angels best song you are kidding right last five years i might be willing to accept but no way did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to say really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century no surprise about robbie williams considering the list where on earth did the nominations list come from compiled by an eleven year old girl perhaps i mean will young come on what a load of crap best song in the last years i don t think so what about all the real artists out there over the last years the list is endless but robbie williams doesn t even come close what a joke that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word angels where i thrash around and scream no no no no no until someone tells me the radio s off why a half baked cheesy ditty like angels which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example and by whom should be voted the best song of the past years is beyond me if this is the song against which all others are judged then musicians may as well give up why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country the initial list was very weak anyway but angels the best song of the last years i think not i didn t realize radio had so many listeners under the age of people have such short memories a great song yes but the best of the last years not a chance i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here the great british public at work again it s a mediocre sentimental and safe song granted it s not too bad either but can it stand up against anything by the smiths in particular how soon is now or anything from the stone roses first album nope no because i m not female and i m not ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song but it is no way the best song of the past years the shortlist wasn t great but him winning it is a joke predictable and laughable the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last years the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie s repertoire never mind best song of the last years i am a huge robbie fan and love that song but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs music out there that influenced music today unfortunately they were left out of the list have radio listeners even heard of joy division a band who through two albums have had a bigger impact on music and continue to do so over the last years than robbie williams ever will no doubt about it there s not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song it should have been joy division those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song i sincerely do not believe that in years from now the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds the beatles and nick drake have done for music today yes i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people there were other great songs in the category but somebody had to win robbie was a deserved winner i am astounded that such a second rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs it s a terrible song voted for by the masses who don t have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music the best song of the past years really come on this is surely a joke no i think i need a long lie down it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division i suppose it s confirmed one thing the british public are consistently dull lt no offence robbie but pleeease there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music and a further nail in the coffin i think robbie deserves it he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide anybody who says he doesn t deserve it is jealous of his success the only real challenger was queen but hey another one bites the dust obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it if this is the best song of the last years then the british music industry is in trouble sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material but this is not the best record a sad day for music it s not the type of music i normally like but even as a diehard rock fan i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people that s why it has been voted best song of the last years it s a good all rounder just like robbie best song in years since i m confused angels isn t a bad song it s a nice catchy formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes but this is not great music if anything it s regressive bland even i suppose it s just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become granted angels is a good song however it really wasn t up against any other proper competition the queen s song was lackluster and apart from kate bush the other choices were pathetic also why weren t the stones there david bowie etc there are so many greater songs than angels i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn t getting more awards so they had to make one up for him best song of the last years what a ridiculuous concept and an even more ridiculous winner sigh on the upside at least it wasn t bohemian rhapsody for which we should all be thankful angels is without doubt a great song but i really don t think it deserves the title of best song in years perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies goodlooks than the actual song don t get me wrong i m not disputing his looks but there are more deserved winners it would have been a travesty had angels not won without angels robbie williams may well not be where he is now and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists it has to be seen performed live with people singing along to be fully appreciated well done rob i find it hard to believe that angels is the best we have to show for the past years i m rapidly redifining best in my own head now to mean most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning what about britpop blur oasis suede pulp not only making fantastic songs but also making changes doing something different why must best always come down to most commercially popular i ve nothing against robbie i actually like his music but how can this possibly be the best song from the last year the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales the same goes with the scissor sisters i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award but the album comes no where near u s new record neither are they in the same league once again there have been some baffling discisions made they are not for artisic reasons but for profit no surprise really it s voted for by the general public since when did they have taste in music personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard it absolutely deserved to win it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come it s an absolute joke however most of the original were very poor choices as well all in all a pretty pointless exercise the song is overplayed and oversentimental out of the rather poor five choices that were left it should have gone to either joy division or queen i suppose we should be thankful that it didn t end up in the hands of will young though although it has nostalgia value there is no way it deserved to win everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody nothing compares u etc much better songs and more timeless give it to someone with real talent although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last years this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that s all it means
