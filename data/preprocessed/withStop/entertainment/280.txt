music man to the oscars bill conti s job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate spinning assignment this year marks conti s th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra the excitement is a live performance as a musician he says all of your colleagues everyone in the film industry is in the theatre all the important people i guess it s just a television show but we always think it s a bit more the orchestra strikes up more than times during the average oscars show as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house it s a very busy evening it takes a certain amount of preparation of music orchestrating sketching rehearsing before the show but you don t know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director it s exciting explains conti and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed we don t know who the winners will be so when they say the winner is we have five different pieces of music in front of us they say the name we play the appropriate one immediately adds conti the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches despite being told to be brief by the show s producers the decision to drown out or kill the offending star with music is relayed from the director s box to the orchestra via conti s earpiece i don t feel good about it at all it s not my call though he says when the director says music the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall we don t usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off the person that s been cut off who s feet from me is glaring at me like it s death time on occasions some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak julia roberts when she came on she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do he says conti received an oscar in for the original score of the right stuff he also received two nominations in the original song category in for gonna fly now from rocky and in for the title song from for your eyes only it s a moment in the sun he says when people get up there some people this is hard to believe people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining might get a little flustered but there s this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they re either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories behind the scenes the key players such as conti have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with there s a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls i can control hearing in my ears the left ear or the right ear different things at different times i have to communicate with the director i have a little microphone that s attached to my headset to open up that microphone i have a footswitch he explains conti s most nerve wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director in when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke conti immediately told the show s director i start cursing and screaming i tell him we re not going to die for this show you must do something or i m going to climb out of this pit with musicians and we re going to be home in minutes oh no bill don t do anything came the response imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra or so of them in the pit and while we re playing firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands no one died it s not a big story but it was scary at the time laughs conti when the ceremony is over the music director attends the annual governor s ball with his family i have a drink and relive the show he says i m not for too much carousing i go home and unwind it takes me about a day
