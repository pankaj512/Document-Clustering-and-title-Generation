german music in a zombie state the german music business the third largest in the world is in the state of a zombie because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy a leading industry figure has said tim renner the head of universal music germany until last year told bbc world service s the music biz programme that the country s music industry was now struggling to survive renner warned that unless the industry accepted new realties such as downloading its decline could become irreversible the problem the music industry has got is that they aren t willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out he stated so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie the music market in germany peaked in with sales of bn euros bn since sales have plummeted to just bn euros bn in in the space of one year between and cd album sales fell by but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold mr renner pointed out that because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good selling record this was particularly damaging you need time he added however peter zombic the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany said he did not feel the situation was as dramatic as mr renner believed it s quite true that we have severe problems in germany but that s true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too he argued we have a severe problem with piracy especially internet piracy and we also have a severe problem of private copying i don t agree that the music industry lost control over the music market in fact especially in regard to germany talent the market is quite successful he did however admit that copyright owners have partly lost control of their copyright due to piracy and copying but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading we were the first to implement a download service back in he argued at that time it was not successful because of the advent of piracy it was the napster time when p p services became popular it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends without fear of breaking copyright mr zombic said that this legal framework was a huge problem there is a widespread attitude that private copying is a hobby it s nice it s fun he added we try to make clear it s not nice and it s not fun it s endangering the creativity in our country
